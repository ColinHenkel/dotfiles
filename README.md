# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, a collection of configuration files and scripts that I use to customize my development environment. Feel free to explore, use, and modify them as needed. My current layout is a modifed form of JaKooLit's dots, as I saw his video and thought they were very nice. His link will be in additional resources!

## Installation

I do not currently have an install script, however I am planning to make one. To install these dotfiles on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masirith/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

2. **Drag and replace:**
- Drag the files into your current .config folder. PLEASE make sure to backup your current dotfiles in case something goes wrong.

## Usage
Once the dotfiles are installed, you can customize your environment further. Here are some key features:
- Hypr
	- An easy to customize Hyprland configuration for optimized window management.
- Nvim Configuration
  - Customized Nvim settings for an enhanced editing experience.
- Shell Configuration
	- Configurations for TEs like kitty, alacritty, foot, and zsh Shell for a more productive terminal environment.

- Thunar
	- Configuration for the Thunar file manager, allowing for easy customization through the use of GTK Settings.

## Customization
Feel free to customize any configuration file to suit your preferences. The structure of the dotfiles is designed to be modular and easy to extend. You can add your own configurations or modify existing ones without affecting the entire setup.
